# Security Chips in CPUs – Practical Experiments

This repository contains the practical experiments developed in the context of an academic assignment on **hardware-assisted security mechanisms in modern CPUs**, with a particular focus on:

- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**
- **ARM TrustZone**
- **Apple Secure Enclave (security model demonstration)**

The experiments are designed to empirically demonstrate key security properties such as **isolation**, **measured boot**, **secure storage**, and **non-exportable cryptographic keys**, complementing the theoretical analysis presented in the associated IEEE-style paper.
